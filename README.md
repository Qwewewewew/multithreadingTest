# Multithreading test in java

Continuing to mess around with java stuff and creating some sort of portfolio

The program compares the time performance of bubble sorting two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, `"count"` integers in range of `[0, limit]` each in single/multithread

The first part is executed in single thread, the second one is split into two.

##### Running program
either use `.jar` located in the `out` directory or compile and run by yourself:
```
cd ./src/
javac Main.java -d ../bin/
cd ../bin/
java Main
```
